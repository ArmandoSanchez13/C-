# C-This is a c++ program that checks if a credit card is valid and it displays the type. Checks if it's Visa, American Express and Dicover
The user must first have a file that contains the data in the same folder as the program.
Once the user runs the program, a prompt should appear to enter the name of the file.
After the program runs, a output.txt is made which displays if the credit card is valid and the type of card.
